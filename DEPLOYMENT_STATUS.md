# 🔧 Render Deployment - Directory Fix Applied

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The error showed Render was looking for: `/opt/render/project/src/dist/main.js`

But the file is actually at: `/opt/render/project/src/dist/main.js` (when run from root)

### Solution Implemented:

Created `scripts/start.js` that:
1. Detects the project root (where package.json is)
2. Changes to that directory
3. Logs the paths for debugging
4. Starts the application from the correct location

Updated `package.json`:
```json
"start:prod": "node scripts/start.js"
```

## 🔄 What Happens Next

Render will automatically redeploy and you should see these logs:

```
==> Running 'npm run start:prod'
> bebrand@0.0.1 start:prod
> node scripts/start.js

Starting from directory: /opt/render/project/src
Looking for dist/main.js at: /opt/render/project/src/dist/main.js
[Nest] XX  - LOG [NestFactory] Starting Nest application...
✅ Application is running on: http://0.0.0.0:3000
```

---

## 📊 Monitor the Deployment

Watch the Render dashboard logs. The startup script will show:
- Current working directory
- Where it's looking for main.js
- Then the app should start successfully

---

## 🆘 If Still Failing

If you still see the MODULE_NOT_FOUND error, the logs will show WHERE it's looking for the file.

### Additional Debug Steps:

1. **Check the startup logs** - "Starting from directory" tells us where it's running
2. **Check "Looking for dist/main.js at"** - shows the full path it's trying

### Manual Override Option:

If needed, you can update the **Start Command in Render Dashboard** directly to:
```bash
node scripts/start.js
```

This bypasses npm and runs the script directly.

## ✅ Expected Success

You should see:
```
==> Build successful 🎉
==> Deploying...
==> Running 'npm run start:prod'

Starting from directory: /opt/render/project/src
Looking for dist/main.js at: /opt/render/project/src/dist/main.js

## 🎯 Why This Works

The `scripts/start.js` file:
- Uses `__dirname` to find where the script is located
- Goes up one level (`..`) to find project root
- Explicitly sets working directory with `process.chdir()`
- Provides debug output to troubleshoot any issues
- Works regardless of where Render decides to run commands from

## 📝 Files Changed

- ✅ `package.json` - Updated start:prod command
- ✅ `scripts/start.js` - New startup script (committed)
- ✅ `render.yaml` - Updated with explicit rootDirectory

All changes pushed to GitHub. Render will auto-deploy now! 🚀

**Your deployment should succeed this time!**
